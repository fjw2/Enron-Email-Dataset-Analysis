# Enron-Email-Dataset-Analysis
Final Project for Udacity's Data Analyst Nanodegree


In 2000, Enron was one of the largest companies in the United States. By 2002, it had collapsed into bankruptcy due to widespread corporate fraud. In the resulting Federal investigation, a significant amount of typically confidential information entered into the public record, including tens of thousands of emails and detailed financial data for top executives.

This project will analyze the dataset provided and create an algorithm to identify potential employees that may have committed fraud during the scandal.
